### NOTES ###

#Each declaration should include a comment explaining its use
#Each subprogram (function,subroutine,object) should have an opening comment describing its purpose
#Each loop should be preceded by a comment that describes its purpose
#Any statement that is particularly unclear or tricky should have a clarifying comment

#near-miss(x,y,z,n,k)
#2 < n < 12
#10 <=x <= k
#10 <=y <= k

#NOTES: program takes n for the power, and k, which should be AT LEAST >=10 AND have an upper limit to stop crashing


### PROGRAM ###

#NEAR-MISS PROGRAM: ITERATE THROUGH ALL z NATURAL NUMBERS FOR GIVEN X and Y
  # CALCULATE (x^n + y^n)

  # FIND z and z+1 such that z^n < (x^n + y^n) < (z+1)^n
  
  # DETERMINE closer value (between z and z+1)

  #SOLVE: ( (x^n + y^n) - ( (z+=1) ^ n) ) / (x^n + y^n) for RELATIVE size of the miss

#ITERATE through all possible x and y natural numbers, tracking lowest relative miss

#FOR EACH NEW SMALLEST RELATIVE MISS: PRINT current x,y,z, actual miss (x^n + y^n) - ( (z+=1) ^ n) and
#relative miss ( (x^n + y^n) - ( (z+=1) ^ n) ) / (x^n + y^n)

### SUBMISSION RULES ###

#Submit only the clone command; I will run it according to the readme file that should be available on github
#Include necessary libraries
